				<h1>Usage</h1>
				<div class="col-1-2">
					In the left-hand box, enter your data in columns. Where the first column
					is the HLA type you want to examine, and the second column is the position
					in each sequence to examine concatenated with the amino acid to count. These
					columns must be separated by a tab. For example: if the entry was 
					<span class="bold">B*51:01 {tab} 25P</span> the program would look at every
					sequence and count how many people have B*51:01, have a P at position 25, have both,
					and have neither.
				</div>
				<div class="col-1-2">
					In the right-hand box, the fist column <span class="bold">must</span> be a unique identifier 
					for that patient/sequence. The next 6 columns should contain HLA type information such as 
					"B*51:01" or "B5101". The order does not matter. The last column should be the <span class="bold">nucleotide</span>
					sequence of that patient's HIV sequence. Translation is done in-house, and will attempt to resolve mixture nucleotides
					into amino acids if all possible codons resolve to the same amino acid. It will otherwise be unknown and cannot be 
					included in calculations.
